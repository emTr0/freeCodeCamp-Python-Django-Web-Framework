# freeCodeCamp - Python Django Web Framework

This repo contains the results of following [freeCodeCamp's tutorial for the Python Django web framework](https://youtu.be/F5mRW0jo-U4). I decided to run through this in the middle of my full stack cloud development program to improve my foundational Django knowledge. The code is complete since it is not for production, and any credentials included were made for the purpose of completing this project.
